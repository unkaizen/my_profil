				<h2 id="titre2"> My hobbies </h2>
				<div>
					<h3>Reading</h3>
					<p id="reading">The fact to read is something I need, some people prefer some kind of book, but for me, reading and writing is more than that. I think that all af kind of book can be read, because the autor when he write his book he have an incredible power of imagination, for me that think is the most importatnt think. In some kind of book, there is a moral and other show diferent tradition and culture, all of this is created for the reader and this has a impact on this reader, it can be shock, anger, sadness or something else and with this the reader can evolve.</p>

				<div>
					<h3>Sport</h3>
					<p id="sport">I love sport, it's something who permit to be with ur friend like in basket ball. I swim a lot and swim learn to me to not give up at the first hard test. I love ski because it's a lot of peasure and fun.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Video game</h3>
					<p id="game">A lot of people think that video game can be mad for my generation, and i  understand that; but video game it's more than that. I explain, video game can be a passion, like we can this with the streamers and the gamers. I think video game can be a separate world, some creator of video want to create a new world, and they do all they can to create him with the good atmosphere, the good music, the good game play, the good story; and when all of this think is in one game, this game is more beautifull, more moralizing than book, film and other think, because it's you who play and you who descover this world like you want. And for me, all of this think can be reunited in the game OUTER WILDS. And this is video of this game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss6vLmLcCbU" target="_blank" id="bouton1">click here</a></p>
